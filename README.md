## Project Details

### Overview
This project uses AI to make AYUSH treatments more accessible and trustworthy. It will allow users to get reliable information and recommendations easily.  This solution will act as a bridge that connects the traditional medicine with modern technology to provide awareness and healthcare support.

### Problem Statement
Despite a growing interest in natural medicine and AYUSH based healthcare practices, most people, especially urban dwellers, lack proper knowledge and access to such credible and sustainable healthcare solutions preventing them form adopting these practices.

### Solution
We propose an AI-driven application that helps increase awareness and knowledge regarding AYUSH based medical practices offering personalized guidance and natural remedies for everyday health concerns. It also promotes overall wellness and sustainable healthcare, making natural healing accessible to all.
